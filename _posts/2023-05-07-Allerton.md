# Chellow Dean, Allerton
7th May 2023

<blockquote><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>  I've enjoyed spending one to one time with this one, because I don't get to do that that often...and we drew the same thing so that's really cool. <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></blockquote>

Eleven of us gathered, in the drizzle, just before dawn outside the Fleece Inn at the corner of Allerton Road and North Parade in Allerton this morning.

Our walk leader Chris, handed out torches, sit mats and waterproofs to those that wanted them and then leds us to a spot in the woods on the edge of Chellow Dean.

This Sense Of Place event was planned to be part of <a href="https://soundtent.org/soundcamp_reveil.html">Reveille 2023</a>, an international broadcast of the Dawn Chorus from around the globe. 

Our plan was to <a href="http://streams.soundtent.org/2023/streams/utc1_-d95d6836-c849-4c39-aa01-5d732f38afae">broadcast the sounds we heard</a> as part of that event. Unfortunately there were technical problems at their end that meant we would not be able to connect our stream, but we did make a recording.

When stayed in the woods for about 40 minutes, as twilight turn into sunrise at 5:20am, witnessing the dawning of the day.

Some people did some drawing, others simply took in the land and soundscape.

At sunrise, Julie served up hot chocolate and croissants for everyone, and after a group photo and a moment of reflection we were led back to the Fleece (in the daylight), said our farewells and headed home.
