# All Saints Parish Church, Bingley
29th November 2022

This event was limited to 25 places, so with artists and helpers about 30 of us took part in A Sense of Place at [All Saints Parish Church](https://www.allsaintsbingley.org.uk/), where we gathered to listen to sounds designed to anchor people in time and place. 

Listening collectively, the audience was challenged to think about the ways in which we listen in a deeper way.

The event also provided an opportunity to respond creatively to the sound. We provided 'listening kits' so people could engage in some mindful stitching, sketching or writing, which most people took advantage of.

The event ended with the ringing of the church bells, as the regular Tuesday evening practice starts each week at 7:30pm. 

## Climate Impact

We have tried to make this a low-carbon event by design.

The biggest carbon impact of this event was probably audience travel to the event. The venue is close to a bus stop, and Bingley Train Station is 5 -10 minutes walk away.

BUS: The event was timed to work well for anyone travelling on the 662 bus in either direction. Max fare is Â£2 one way.

TRAIN: Travel to and from Keighley worked well for this event. From Bradford, it worked well for the start, but people would have had some time to kill before the return train.

People's intention to travel was as follows:<br/>
Bicycle: 2<br/>
Bus: 3<br/>
Car share: 1<br/>
Other: 1<br/>
Own vehicle: 6<br/>
Train: 6<br/>
Walk / Self- powered: 3<br/>

We don't have data for exactly how people did travel on the day.

Our next Carbon Cost was the church heating which ran for an hour before and through to the end of the event.

Our final Carbon Costs were in the materials we used. This was mitigated by all the contents of the listening kits coming from end of line 'scrap' stock left over that we collectively had lying around.
