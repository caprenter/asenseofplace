# Allerton
2nd May 2023

Final preparations are in place for our next Sense Of Place event in the early hours of 7th May 2023.

We've teamed up with some people that live near Chellow Dean - an area of woodland and reservoirs - to plan a dawn chorus event.

We're going to <a href="http://streams.soundtent.org/2023/streams/utc1_-d95d6836-c849-4c39-aa01-5d732f38afae">broadcast the sounds we hear</a> as part of <a href="https://soundtent.org/soundcamp_reveil.html">Reveille 2023</a>, an international broadcast of the Dawn Chorus from around the globe. 

We've invited some people to meet at 4:15am at The Fleece Inn at the corner of Allerton Road and North Parade, BD15 7DY, then walk as a group via North Parade, with our walk leader Chris, to a spot in the woods on the edge of Chellow Dean.

When we reach our place in the woods we will stay there until the sun has risen (5:20am) and witness the dawning of the day.

We anticipate that people will make their own creative responses to the event through drawing, writing, poetry, and so on.

Once the sun has risen our walk leader will guide people back to the Fleece Inn.
