# Wellbeing Walk Training, Cliffe Castle, Keighley
September 2023 to March 2024

The Cliffe Castle Wellbeing Walk is a gentle sensory walk, through areas of woodland, wildflowers and wildlife. There is a self-guided [Wellbeing Walk leaflet](https://bradforddistrictparks.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Cliffe-Castle-Wellness-Walk.pdf) and the [Cliffe Castle Support Group](https://cliffecastlepark.org.uk/) has been training people for the community so that they can lead their own walks.

A Sense Of Place was involved in the most recent training sessions, bringing expertise and experience around the value of sound, and offering basic training in the use of smart phones to record sound as a wellbeing practice.

The session were organised and run by Val Preston from [Truly Essential](https://trulyessential.co.uk/).

It was great to see people engaging with the sense of sound as we carried out the walks and the training. I like the way that giving your walk a focus (sound in this case) can just give you a different experience of a familiar place. A number of people dstarted to take phone recordings, and to send them to me.
