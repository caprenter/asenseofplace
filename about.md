A Sense Of Place began as a series of events, with a minimal carbon footprint, based in the Bradford district. They were, and continue be, events that  bring people, artists, and our local environment together for an experience that will stay long in the mind.

Supported by a testing and development grant from [Bradford Producing Hub](https://bdproducinghub.co.uk/), we ran 3 events over a 12 months period starting in 2022.

Since then A Sense Of Place continues and ad hoc project, working on opportunities as they arise.

Back in 2022/23 the project was a collaboration between 5 Bingley based artists: 

* [Hannah Lamb](https://www.hannahlamb.co.uk/) is a textile artist, lecturer and author.  
* [David Carpenter](https://theargentgrub.co.uk/) is a musician, songwriter and producer creating music as [The Argent Grub](https://theargentgrub.co.uk/).  
* [Lukas Hornby](https://grst1.bandcamp.com/music) is a musician and sound artist.  
* [Nicola Storr](https://www.instagram.com/nicolourok/) is an illustrator.  
* [Stuart Bannister](https://sensoryleakage.bandcamp.com/album/zener-09) is a musician and sound artists.

<p>Hannah Lamb is a textile artist, lecturer and author, based at her home studio in Bingley, West Yorkshire. Her creative practice focusses on recording a sense of place through careful observation and material investigation. She works with a range of textile processes, including stitch, print and fabric manipulation, creating textile artworks from an intimate scale to larger installation works.</p>
<p>
    An interest in textile archives and local textile industry has led to recent research projects and exhibitions with Salts Mill, Bradford Textile Archive, Sunny Bank Mills and Bradford School of Art.
    Hannah's first solo book, Poetic Cloth; Creating Meaning in Textile Art, was published by Batsford (2019).
    Hannah Lamb gained a BA (Hons.) Embroidery (2001) and MA Textiles (2010) from Manchester Metropolitan University.

<p>Lukas performs solo drone, turntable, and sampled percussion as GRST. He began 2022 with a number of firsts, self-releasing his debut EP on bandcamp and his first physical release on a compilation of drone with label Difficult Art and Music.

<p>Lukas also DJs around the world (or virtually at least) as DJ %username% and much of his performance both live and as DJ is has an audio-visual element, making extensive use of lo-fi and bleeding edge digital techniques for live video production including Machine Learning and GANs.</p>
