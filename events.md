All our events invite a small, intimate, local, group of people to a listening experience that we hope will act as a starting point for people to explore their own creativity.

The sound of some events will be broadcast live to the internet via the [Locus Sonus sound map](http://locusonus.org/soundmap/051/). You are welcome to make you own audio recordings.

Other people may be drawing, writing, creating poetry, crafting, or simply just taking in the world around them.

We hope that some people will create something after the event - a song, a modified recording, a painting, who knows?
