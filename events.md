All events allow a small, intimate, local, group of people to experience the Dawn Chorus together, as a starting point to explore your own creativity.

The sound of each event will be broadcast live to the internet via the [Locus Sonus sound map](http://locusonus.org/soundmap/051/). You are welcome to make you own audio recordings.

Other people may be drawing, writing, creating poetry, crafting, or simply just taking in the world around them.

We hope that some people will create something after the event - a song, a modified recording, a painting, who knows?
