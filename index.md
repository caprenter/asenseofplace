Gather at dawn for an immersive, live, outdoor, experience that connects people to each other, nature, the built environment, their own creativity, and with a global audience, at specific times and places in our city.

Bradford itself is the main event, and your senses are the key to unlocking the performance. A low-impact event that will leave a long lasting impression.
