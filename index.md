We are surrounded by incredible, remarkable sights and sounds in our own backyard that we often take for granted, or ignore completely. We forget that the whole world is a stage.

A Sense of Place creates experiences that connect people to each other, nature, the built environment, their own creativity, and with a global audience, at specific times and places in our city.

Bradford itself is the main event, and your senses are the key to unlocking the experience. A low-impact event that will leave a long lasting impression.
